      <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
      <p>
        Hello there, my name is Perry and I am extremely passionate about hands-on tech; with particular interest in securing 
        data, systems and assets. I thrive on solving complex problems, learning continuously, and sharing knowledge with others. 
        With a strong foundation in IT and digital marketing, and over a decade of experience in sales and leadership, I bring 
        both technical versatility and people-centered communication skills to every project. I'm especially interested in how 
        data-driven decision-making and secure infrastructure intersect in modern enterprise environments.

   <h2>Home Network Overhaul & Segmentation</h2>
  
  <p class="project-summary">
    Below is a sanitized overview of my home network topology, with a focus on security monitoring and threat detection. The 
    architecture implements defense-in-depth principles through network segmentation, passive IDS monitoring, honeypot deployment, 
    and centralized logging.

      <p>
        In my updated network architecture we utilize a managed switch, with port isolation, to an isolated router supporting the honeypot for ongoing threat analysis and education.
        In the production network, all routing, DHCP, and DNS control is handled by a custom router with strict firewall rules governing inbound and outbound traffic. DNS traffic 
        is forcibly redirected to an internal DNS stack at the firewall level to ensure consistent enforcement of filtering and privacy controls across the network.
      </p>
      <p><strong><u>My updated network architecture includes:</u></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>VLAN 20:</strong> Primary/trusted devices (workstations, laptops, mobile devices)</li>
        <li><strong>VLAN 10:</strong> IoT devices (smart home, cameras, sensors) - isolated from trusted network to prevent potential lateral movement in the event a device is compromised</li>
        <li><strong>IDS Monitoring:</strong> Suricata passive IDS deployed with SPAN port mirroring for complete LAN traffic visibility without inline performance impact, and implemented real-time security 
          alerting via custom bash script that monitors Suricata IDS logs, updating a dashboard automatically at specific intervals and triggers desktop notifications on Pi's 7-inch display for immediate threat visibility</li>
        <li><strong>DNS Security:</strong> Pi-hole + Unbound for ad-blocking and telemetry-reduction via fully recursive DNS resolution, as well as the implementation of DNSSEC</li>
        <li><strong>Honeypot Network:</strong> Isolated Cowrie SSH/Telnet honeypot via separate router on different subnet than production network, port isolated virtually with managed switch, for threat intelligence and attack pattern analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> All security events aggregated to external storage for correlation and forensic analysis</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Security Features:</strong> VLAN segmentation, passive IDS monitoring, SSH hardening (key-based auth, fail2ban), strict firewall rules, honeypot deployment, zero-trust architecture</p>
      <p><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> Suricata IDS, Pi-hole, Unbound DNS, Cowrie Honeypot, pfSense/custom router, VLAN (802.1Q), Wireshark, nmap, tcpdump, SPAN/port mirroring, Linux (Debian/Raspberry Pi OS)</p>

    <h2>Pi-hole + Unbound: DNS Security & Privacy</h2>
<article class="project-item">
  
  <p class="project-summary">
    To eliminate ad-serving, block telemetry, and achieve DNS privacy, I deployed Pi-hole with Unbound for fully recursive DNS 
    resolution. This configuration ensures all DNS queries are resolved directly from root and authoritative nameservers rather than forwarded to public resolvers,
    eliminating reliance on third-party DNS resolvers like Google or Cloudflare.
  </p>

  </div>
  
  <div class="project-accordion-wrapper">
    
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>Approaching DNS resolution in this manner eliminates a common availability, privacy and security risk by not relying on a singular 
      upstream DNS resolver, circumventing potential DNS/connectivity issues in the event of a third-party server's unexpected downtime, and also reducing fingerprinting risks associated with 
      centralized query logging. DNSSEC validation is enabled to provide cryptographic assurance of DNS authenticity; which mitigates DNS spoofing, cache poisoning, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
      upholding the Confidentiality and Integrity pillars of the CIA triad.</p>
      
      <p><strong><u>Implementation Process:</u></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Installed and configured Pi-hole with Unbound as recursive DNS resolver</li>
        <li>Configured router to force all DNS traffic through Pi-hole at the firewall level (no client bypass)</li>
        <li>Set up custom blocklists and whitelist exceptions for legitimate services</li>
        <li>Analyzed DNS query logs to identify suspicious domains and IOC patterns</li>
        <li>Configured DNSSEC validation for query integrity and authenticity</li>
        <li>Monitored DNS performance metrics and cache hit rates for optimization</li>
        <li>Integrated DNS logs with centralized logging for security correlation</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> Pi-hole, Unbound DNS, Raspberry Pi OS, SSH, DNSSEC, DNS query logging, sqlite3, regex filtering</p>
      <p><strong>Key Achievement:</strong> Achieved complete DNS privacy and ad-blocking across entire network with 100% query coverage ensuring no 
      device can bypass filtering, even with hardcoded DNS settings.</p>

    <h2>Custom DNS Query Analytics Dashboard</h2>
    
    <p class="project-summary">
      After deploying Pi-hole with Unbound as my recursive DNS server, I built an automated bash script to extend visibility of historical queries and other stats 
      beyond the metrics provided by the standard Pihole GUI admin interface, in order to provide anomaly detection and deeper insights. This tool analyzes 90+ days of DNS 
      query logs (8M+ queries) and generates interactive HTML reports with queries by hour of day, day of the week, query total, as well as client health scoring 
      and usage pattern analysis.
